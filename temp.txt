About

I’m Nathan Higgs, founder of Higgs Production Services, where we cut through the noise in construction and production management. My focus is simple: streamline material orders, schedule labor with precision, and eliminate operational drag that slows projects down.

I’ve built my career around execution, delegation, and systems that scale. I don’t micromanage—I empower. I don’t just solve problems—I build infrastructure so they don’t come back.

Whether it’s coordinating complex subcontractor schedules or getting critical materials on-site before anyone has to ask, I’m in the business of making sure the work flows—and the team doesn’t miss a beat.

If you’re scaling fast, juggling too much, or just tired of duct-taping operations together, let’s connect. I’m always open to conversations around process design, automation, subcontractor finance solutions, and turning chaos into momentum.
